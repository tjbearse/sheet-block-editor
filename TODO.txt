KNOWN ISSUES:
- multiple formulas. Multiple can be generated from blocks but cannot be put back into blocks
- loading / status indicator
	load
	submit
- Appscript setup / permissions


WISHLIST
- automate deployments
	- clasp integration
	- build package as used by appscript
	  - rename files
	  - inline js to html automatically / use include syntax
- Idea: formulas as a single block with mutator that searches for formulas and then takes definition
- Could we load "advanced" functions dynamically if requested?
	 Generate "advanced" into a separate bundle
	 Load advanced dynamically
	 Adapt pattern for appscript deployment
- block search
- don't generate commas for trailing null ouputs?
- implement the variadic & paired optional arg functions with notes in the TODO field
	I did a quick and broad simplification of arguments to remove these features until they are properly done
	look at mutators like the list mutator https://github.com/google/blockly/blob/master/blocks/lists.js#L119-L273
- dedup / simplify / shorten the generated generator code
- input & output types
- add N/A to values as well
- sheets functionality
	- array values block
	- support custom functions
	- named ranges
- improve color scheme
- make help links
- remove "learn more" from text
- copy to clipboard button
- typescript the code
