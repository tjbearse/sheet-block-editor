Sheet Block Editor is a block-based visual programming editor for Google Sheets. The editor can read a text formula and represent its parts as building blocks. These blocks can be edited and reconfigured then writen back out as text for use in a Google Sheet. Formulas can also be made with blocks from scratch.

Currently the editor is in an experimental state. The editor exists on its own [webpage](https://tjbearse.github.io/sheet-block-editor/) to be used alongside Google Sheets via copying and pasting. Adapting the editor to be an extension for Google Sheets is in development and will provide a smoother integration. Additionally, there are some functionality limitations. The formula list is limited for space and organizing concerns. Some extended formula arguments are not implemented.

If you encounter bugs or would like to suggest an improvement please create an issue.
