Sheet Block Editor

[![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

Sheet Block Editor is a block-based visual programming editor for Google Sheets. The editor can read a text formula and represent its parts as building blocks. These blocks can be edited and reconfigured then writen back out as text for use in a Google Sheet. Formulas can also be made with blocks from scratch. [Try it out](https://tjbearse.github.io/sheet-block-editor/)

Currently the editor is in an experimental state. The editor exists on its own [webpage](https://tjbearse.github.io/sheet-block-editor/) to be used alongside Google Sheets via copying and pasting. Adapting the editor to be an extension for Google Sheets has been started and would provide a smoother integration. Additionally, there are some functionality limitations. See the list of [known feature gaps](https://github.com/tjbearse/sheet-block-editor/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22unsupported+forumulas%22).

If you encounter bugs or would like to suggest an improvement please create an issue.
